# Validation V34

```bash
python -m compileall -q services/python-worker/carepoint_python_worker
PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 PYTHONPATH=services/python-worker python -m pytest -q services/python-worker/tests/test_worker_contracts.py --disable-warnings
PYTHONPATH=services/python-worker python scripts/option_b/verify_python_worker.py
unzip -tq CarePoint_option_B_python_progressive_v34.zip
```

Expected: 112 tests passing, worker verification passing, and ZIP integrity clean. TypeScript full build remains for CI/staging with real dependencies.
